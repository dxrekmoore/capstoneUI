### Setting Up 

all the files are already generated by the following steps, no need to to it again 

1. make sure the latest node.js is installed. (https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. in the client folder terminal, type command `npx create-react-app ./` 

3. in the server folder terminal, type command `npm init -y`, this will create a jason file illustrate the dependency 

4. in the server folder terminal, type command `npm install body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon`

5. in the client folder terminal, type command `npm install axios moment react-file-base64 redux redux-thunk`

6. to run the server side folder using `npm start`, if it warns  'nodemon command no find', install nodemon by typeingcommand `sudo npm install -g --force nodemon`

7. in client side, install ui by command: `npm install @material-ui/core`

8. in client side, install redux by command: `npm install react-redux`

2. Whenever you change the jason file, you need to rerun the terminal 
3. in client/package.jason , i added `"proxy":"http://localhost:5000",` to amke sure the local netwrok works
